/**
 * Apply MCP-related and tool-allowance settings to a SDK queryOptions dict.
 *
 * This is a thin wrapper around `applyAiSettingsToQueryOptions` (core/services).
 * The actual logic — mcpServers preparation, allowedTools wildcards
 * (`mcp__<server>__*` REQUIRED for the SDK to permit MCP tools, even under
 * bypassPermissions), tools filtering, skills overrides — lives in
 * core/services/sdkQueryOptions.ts so the headless runtime can reuse it.
 *
 * Kept here as a named seam so sessionManager.createSession reads as four
 * orchestrated steps (auth / build / configure / wire) rather than a flat
 * 150-line function. No behavioural change; this function MUST remain
 * intent-preserving with the original inline call.
